# covid-19 dashboard

The repo contains code references and materials used in a [10-part tutorial series](https://finetut.com/courses/build-covid-web-dashboard-in-r/) on developing a real-time analytics app to monitor the covid-19 (coronavirus) situation, and in the process learn about:
- Data visualization in base R  
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`  
- Cleaning and transforming data using `tidyverse` libraries: `dplyr`, `tidyr` etc  
- Web app / dashboard development using `shiny`

Build and deploy a real-time analytics dashboard (optionally with your custom sub-domain, for free) with this multi-part lesson. The course will walk you through the process of cleaning data, creating highly compelling data visualizations, and then combining them with a web app framework that is pleasant and visually appealing.

By the end of this course, you will have a web dashboard that is deployed and accessible on the web by anyone, on any devices (responsive web design).

## Learning Outcomes

- Learn to develop a modern, reactive web application using R and the Shiny Web App framework
- Learn to use one of the most popular, powerful data visualization library (ggplot) to create compelling visuals on the web
- Learn to take advantage of modern web development practices such as Bootstrap 4, responsive web design, and UX thinking
- Learn how a framework like Shiny allows you to author your application by transforming your R code into HTML, CSS and JavaScript.
- Learners are expected to develop their own dashboard, and deploy to the free shinyapps.io hosting service.
