# covid-19 dashboard

The repo contains code references and materials used in a 11-part tutorial series on developing a real-time analytics app to monitor the covid-19 (coronavirus) situation, and in the process learn about:
- Data visualization in base R  
- Data visualization using `ggplot2`  
- Web app / dashboard development using `shiny`  
- Cleaning and transforming data using `tidyverse`  

Learners are expected to develop their own dashboard, and deploy to the free shinyapps.io hosting service.
